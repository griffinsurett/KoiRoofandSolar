I had an excellent experience with Richie & John from Koi Solar for my roof replacement. They beat all other quotes I received and still delivered the exact high-end materials I had requested—top-tier brands that are usually very expensive. Richie made it all happen within my budget, which was impressive. The entire process was smooth and stress-free. Richie and his team showed up on time, worked efficiently, and completed the entire roof in just one day with a team of true professionals. I never had to worry about whether the job would get done right—highly recommend Koi Solar for quality, honesty, and outstanding service.
